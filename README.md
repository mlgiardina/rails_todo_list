#Todo List in Rails
##Description
This project involved creating a basic todo list program within Rails. It involves one database table named "todos," and one corresponding model. All responses are given in JSON format. I used the following versions of ruby and rails:

- Ruby version 2.2.0
- Rails version 4.2.1

##How to Use
- If you navigate to http://localhost:3000/, it will take you to the index page which displays all todos within the database.
- If you navigate to http://localhost:3000/todos/, it will display all todos within the database.
- You can specify which todo you want to see by navigating to http://localhost:3000/todos/::ID NUMBER::
- The program responds to GET, DELETE, PUT, and POST http requests, with all responses given in JSON format.
